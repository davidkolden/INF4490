\section{Introduction}
This report documents the results of implementing different algorithms to solve the 'Traveling salesman problem'. Four different algorithms are tested: exhaustive search, hill climbing, a genetic algorithm and a hybrid algorithm using elements from the genetic- and the hill climbing algorithm.

All the algorithms are more or less inspired by the examples and pseudo codes in \cite{eiben} and \cite{marsland}
 
\section{Exhaustive search}

This algorithm was made based on \cite[chapter 9.4.1]{marsland}. The program ineffectively searches every permutation of the number of cities, which means it searches permutations that in reality represents the same distances ([1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 2, 1], etc.)

Start the program
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
	$ python3 exhaustive.py european_cities.csv 
\end{lstlisting}
The program will find the shortest tour between 6 - 10 cities. The program outputs

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
	For n_cities = 6:
	Best distance: 5018.8099999999995
	Best sequence: (0, 1, 4, 5, 2, 3)
	Best order of travel: Barcelona Belgrade Bucharest Budapest Berlin 
	Brussels Barcelona
 
	For n_cities = 7:
	Best distance: 5487.889999999999
	Best sequence: (2, 6, 3, 0, 1, 4, 5)
	Best order of travel: Berlin Copenhagen Brussels Barcelona Belgrade 
	Bucharest Budapest Berlin
 
	For n_cities = 8:
	Best distance: 6667.489999999999
	Best sequence: (3, 7, 0, 1, 4, 5, 2, 6)
	Best order of travel: Brussels Dublin Barcelona Belgrade Bucharest 
	Budapest Berlin Copenhagen Brussels
 
	For n_cities = 9:
	Best distance: 6678.549999999999
	Best sequence: (2, 6, 8, 3, 7, 0, 1, 4, 5)
	Best order of travel: Berlin Copenhagen Hamburg Brussels Dublin 
	Barcelona Belgrade Bucharest Budapest Berlin
 
	For n_cities = 10:
	Best distance: 7486.309999999999
	Best sequence: (6, 8, 3, 7, 0, 1, 9, 4, 5, 2)
	Best order of travel: Copenhagen Hamburg Brussels Dublin Barcelona 
	Belgrade Istanbul Bucharest Budapest Berlin Copenhagen
	 
	Time spent[seconds]: [0.002037, 0.015967, 0.134317, 1.310069, 
	13.964733]
\end{lstlisting}
The time used by the algorithm to find the best distance was measured. The time spent on solving TSP for six, seven, eight, nine and ten cities is shown in the last two lines of the program output and in figure 1.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{"../Exhaustive.pdf}
\caption{Time spent for the TSP algorithm}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
\noindent
It can be seen that time spent by the algorithm searching for an optimal solution in TSP for  \textit{n} cities is roughly the time spent on searching for \textit{n-1} cities multiplied by \textit{n}. The time spent by the algorithm (on my laptop) to search for the optimal solution in TSP for 24 cities can be calculated with
\[
	t_{10} \frac{24!}{10!} \approx 14s \cdot \frac{24!}{10!} \approx 2.4 \cdot 10^{18}
\]
which is around 76 billion years.

\section{Hill Climbing}
This algorithm was made based on \cite[chapter 9.4.3]{marsland}. 
 
Start the program with
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
	$ python3 hill_climber.py european_cities.csv 
\end{lstlisting}
The program will try to find the shortest route between 10 and the shortest route between 24 cities. The program outputs

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
	For 10 cities:
	Running the algorithm 20 times
	Number of searches per round: 10000
	Best distance: 7503.099999999999
	Worst distance: 8324.82
	Average distance: 7835.56
	Standard deviation: 229.896
	Time taken per search[seconds]: 0.145487
 
	For 24 cities:
	Running the algorithm 20 times
	Number of searches per round: 10000
	Best distance: 19413.899999999998
	Worst distance: 22341.170000000006
	Average distance: 21236.6
	Standard deviation: 751.52
	Time taken per search[seconds]: 2.017303
\end{lstlisting}
\noindent
The best result of 20 hill climber runs gets close to the solution computed by the exhaustive search (7503 vs 7486). Results of 7486 have a been observed during test runs.

The hill climber uses 10000 iterations each run, using a total of 200000 iterations to find this result. The exhaustive search on the other hand uses 10! = 3628800 iterations.

Increasing the iterations used by the hill climber reduces the standard deviation and increases the chances of it finding the optimal distance.

When searching 24 cities, the hill climber uses around two seconds every run, resulting in a total of around 40 seconds for the whole run. This is in strong contrast to the 76 billion years of the exhaustive search. However, the result found is quite far from the optimal one, but gets better if number of iterations increases.

\section{Genetic algorithm}
This algorithm was made based on \cite[chapter 3 - 6]{eiben}. All in all, the algorithm consist of:
\begin{itemize}
\item An initializer: random permutations computed using numpy.
\item A parent selector: using a linear ranking scheme with \textit{s} = 1.5.
\item A crossover algorithm: cycle crossover.
\item A mutating scheme: inversion of subset of cities in the children. Probability of mutation: 50\%
\item Survivor selector: GENITOR. The \textit{n} weakest parents are replaced by \textit{n} children. I have chosen \textit{n} = 4 for all my runs.
\end{itemize}
\noindent
The program was tested with a population of 10, 50 and 100.

Start the program with
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
	$ python3 genetic_algorithm.py european_cities.csv 
\end{lstlisting}
The program will try to find the shortest distance between 24 cities using the three different population sizes, and then do the same with 10 cities. The program outputs:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]

A plot of the average fitness of the best individual of each generation can be seen in figure 2.
\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{"../genetic_algorithm.pdf}
\caption{Average fitness result for the genetic algorithm}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
As shown in the plot and the output, the algorithm converges slower as population size increases. A reason for this might be because the survivor selection do not scale with the population size (\textit{n} = 4 for all population sizes). For this setup, the smaller population size (or the bigger ratio between \textit{n} and population size) gives the most effective and fruitful search.
