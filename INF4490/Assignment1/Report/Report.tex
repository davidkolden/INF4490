\section{Introduction}
Brief explanation of the assignment, how to start the programs
\section{Exhaustive search}
\subsection{Tour of six cities}
Find shortest tour, measure time taken, see how time increases as more cities are added
\subsection{Tour of ten cities}
Find shortest tour, measure time taken, calculate time for 24 cities
\section{Hill Climbing}
Compare with exhaustive for 10 cities, run algorithm 20 times, report best worst mean and standard deviation for 10 runs and 24 runs
\section{Genetic algorithm}
Report parameters used, report best worst mean and deviation of 20 runs with three different values for population size, plot of average fitness of best individual of each run
\section{Hybrid algorithm}
Use hill climber on each individual as part of the evaluation, report min max mean deviation and average fitness with both Lamarckian and Baldwinian learning models, Compare result with GA
